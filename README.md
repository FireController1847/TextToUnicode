# TextToUnicode

This is a simple program I wrote to convert the inputted text to its associated Unicode Hex codes.

More specifically, it was made as a development utility so I could paste strings of text as Unicode into my Assembly x64 programs.

It's not perfect by any means, but I used this to help me learn Assembly x64 as this was my first ever Assembly x64 program.
